# XYLCS Studio's Freedom Creator Standard 3 Editver. 1 (XFCSTD 3E1)

"This Standard applies to any community-oriented, non-private creative works, communities, and individual creators"

## I. Introduction

This Standard defines the Freedom Creation Philosophy, the nature of Freedom Creation, and how to regulate the execution of Freedom Creation. The Freedom Creation Philosophy was first proposed by our XYLCS Studio on August 2, 2023, aiming to create liberating and open creation environments, and to foster a healthy community environment for free and open creation.

## II. Preliminary Definitions

2.1 **Creator Community**: A community composed of multiple creators with similar or identical creative themes.

2.2 **Original Work**: A work created independently by its author. Such author shall be referred to as the "Original Creator."

2.3 **Secondary Creation Work**: A work created by its author through modification and adaptation of an Original Work. Such author shall be referred to as the "Secondary Creator."

2.4 **Freedom**: The ability to engage in diverse creation that complies with this Standard, without violating laws, community regulations that do not contravene this Standard.

2.5 **Openness**: The willingness to accept free creation without violating laws, community regulations that do not contravene this Standard.

2.6 When the community in which a creator operates is not of a Freedom Creation nature, this Standard applies only to creators utilizing this Standard and does not extend to the community itself.

2.7 **Malicious Closure**: Unjustified community behavior that infringes upon others' legitimate rights to disseminate creative content, prohibits others from conducting Freedom Creation in accordance with this Standard, or enforces unequal and unreasonable creative restrictions.

2.8 This Standard adheres to the following "Declaration of the Freedom Creator Spirit (XYLCS Edition)":

1. Creation should be free in nature
2. Creation requires correction—not merely addressing errors in the creative process, but correcting overall negative atmospheres, misguided ideologies, or erroneous tendencies
3. Creation requires continuous innovation
4. Creation is not limited by age, social class, or political affiliation; all creators are equal
5. Creation should maintain collaboration
6. Creation should never cease

2.9 This Standard aims to achieve the goal of Freedom Creation. All provisions of this Standard serve this objective. Utilization of this Standard signifies agreement to abide by all its provisions.

## III. Creation and Creators
